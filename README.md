# Start Here

## **What is Radix**

Radix is a new platform, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but scalable and easy to build on. Instead of using blockchain, we started from scratch with a completely new design so that every person and device in the world could use Radix without centralization or compromise. We created building blocks, making applications, tokens and coins as easy to deploy as possible. It’s fast, it works and our test net is already live.

## **How is Radix different?**

Radix is a speedy alternative to blockchains and DAGs. It uses both the passage of logical time and database sharding to create an immensely secure and scalable system for the shared storage and accessing of data.

It has been the result of 6 years of research and development into a number of unsolved computer science problems. It is redundantly replicated but without the drawbacks of inefficient uses of large amount of power, or blockchain's inability to scale to millions of simultaneous users, without significant compromise or centralizing.

## How does it work?

Radix uses the theory of database sharding to scale linearly and vector clocks for generating a partial ordering of events based on Leslie Lamport’s logical clock theory as the basic consensus mechanism. 

## [Build with Radix](developer/live-platform-overview.md)

If you are a **developer** who wants to learn how to build on the **Radix Test Network,** you can get started with your preferred choice of library:

* [The Java Client Library](developer/java-client-library-guide/)
* [The Kotlin Library](developer/kotlin-client-library-guide/)
* [The JavaScript Library](developer/javascript-client-library-guide/quick-start.md)

The [developer section](developer/live-platform-overview.md) will get you started with building on the Radix Test Network using client libraries with full break-downs on simple code examples for various use-cases that the Radix technology is suitable for. These are intended to give dApp developers a real-world understanding of the underlying logic and potential of the network in their development process.

## [Operate a Radix Node](node-runners/start/)

If you want to run a Radix Node and connect to the Testnet **go to the** [node runner section](node-runners/start/).  
It will walk you through the system requirements and dependencies of the docker container, as well as comprehensive step-by-step instructions which outline how to configure your network environment for running a Radix node and connecting to the Radix testnet. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Node Client is not released yet. Subscribe to the [node runners newsletter](https://radixdlt.typeform.com/to/TGOduF) to get notified.
