## **What is Radix**

Radix is a new platform, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but scalable and easy to build on. Instead of using blockchain, we started from scratch with an entirely new design so that every person and device in the world could use Radix. We created the building blocks that make applications, tokens, and coins as easy to deploy as possible..

## **How is Radix different?**

Radix is a speedy alternative to blockchains and DAGs. It uses a new consensus algorithm called Cerberus, based on a three-commit phase and[ database sharding](http://www.radixdlt.com/post/sharding-in-radix/) to create an immensely secure and scalable system for the shared storage and accessing of data.

It has been the result of 6 years of research and development into a number of unsolved computer science problems. It is redundantly replicated but without the drawbacks of inefficient uses of large amounts of power, or blockchain's inability to scale to millions of simultaneous users

## How does it work?

Radix uses the theory of[ database sharding](http://www.radixdlt.com/post/sharding-in-radix/) to scale linearly and a sharded Byzantine fault-tolerant \(BFT\) solution to the state machine replication \(SMR\) problem. Cerberus introduces a partial ordering regime that enables a novel state sharding approach. With this approach, the consensus process for commands may be massively and safely parallelized across many nodes while retaining optimistic responsiveness and linear message complexity. 

## [Run the Betanet Emulator](develop/betanet-emulator.md)

If you want to run a local single-node Betanet Emulator, go to the [Betanet Emulator section](develop/betanet-emulator.md).  
 It will walk you through the system requirements and dependencies of the docker container, as well as comprehensive step-by-step instructions which outline how to configure your network environment for running the Betanet Emulator.
