## **What is Radix**

Radix is a new platform, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but scalable and easy to build on. Instead of using blockchain, we started from scratch with an entirely new design so that every person and device in the world could use Radix without centralization or compromise. We created the building blocks that make applications, tokens, and coins as easy to deploy as possible. It’s fast, it works, and our test net is already live.

## **How is Radix different?**

Radix is a speedy alternative to blockchains and DAGs. It uses both the passage of logical time and [database sharding](http://www.radixdlt.com/post/sharding-in-radix/) to create an immensely secure and scalable system for the shared storage and accessing of data.

It has been the result of 6 years of research and development into a number of unsolved computer science problems. It is redundantly replicated but without the drawbacks of inefficient uses of large amounts of power, or blockchain's inability to scale to millions of simultaneous users, without significant compromise or centralizing.

## How does it work?

Radix uses the theory of [database sharding](http://www.radixdlt.com/post/sharding-in-radix/) to scale linearly and vector clocks for generating a partial ordering of events based on Leslie Lamport’s logical clock theory as the primary consensus mechanism. 

## [Build with Radix](develop/network/live-platform-overview.md)

If you are a **developer** who wants to learn how to build on the **Radix Network,** you can get started with your preferred library of choice:

* [Java client library](develop/java-client-library/)
* [JavaScript client library](develop/javascript-client-library/quick-start.md)
* [Kotlin client library](develop/kotlin-client-library/)

The [developer section](develop/network/live-platform-overview.md) will get you started with building on the Radix Test Network using client libraries with full break-downs on simple code examples for various [use-cases](learn/use-cases/) that the Radix technology is suitable for. These are intended to give dApp developers a real-world understanding of the underlying logic and potential of the network in their development process.

## [Run the Betanet Emulator](develop/betanet-emulator.md)

If you want to run a local single-node Betanet Emulator, go to the [Betanet Emulator section](develop/betanet-emulator.md).  
 It will walk you through the system requirements and dependencies of the docker container, as well as comprehensive step-by-step instructions which outline how to configure your network environment for running the Betanet Emulator.

## [Operate a Radix Node](node-runners/start/)

If you want to run a Radix Node and connect to the Testnet go to the [node runner section](node-runners/start/).  
It will walk you through the system requirements and dependencies of the docker container, as well as comprehensive step-by-step instructions which outline how to configure your network environment for running a Radix node and connecting to the Radix Testnet.

## [Download The Radix wallets](https://www.radixdlt.com/wallet)

[Download](https://www.radixdlt.com/wallet) the Radix wallets and take them for a test drive on Mac, Windows, Linux, and Android.

## [Learn about Radix](learn/platform/)

To learn more about the Radix project, its history, limitations of current DLTs, its technical [architecture](learn/architecture/) and design philosophy [start here](learn/platform/).
